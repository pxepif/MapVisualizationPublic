#**Map Visualizer**

A small program that visualizes data from simulated and real players using two spreadsheets included in this repository.

Enter your username when prompted.

The map will be generated and saved as testMap.html in the same folder.

###**The map shows:**

  Red markers – gold/first place user locations

  Green markers – silver/second place user locations

  Blue markers – bronze/third place user locations

  Black markers – actual generated locations from the spreadsheets.
